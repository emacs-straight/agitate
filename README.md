# agitate: Extras for diff-mode, vc-git, log-edit, log-view

Agitate is a collection of commands or potentially useful functions
that expand on the available version control features of Emacs.  Those
are meant to complement a workflow that relies on the built-in Version
Control framework and its accoutrements (`diff-mode.el`,
`log-view.el`, `log-edit.el`, `vc-git.el`, and potentially others).
